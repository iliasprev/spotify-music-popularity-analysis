🎵 Spotify Cross-Platform Streaming Analysis
📌 Executive Summary

This project analyses cross-platform engagement signals (Spotify playlists, TikTok, YouTube and Shazam) to determine which factors most strongly influence Spotify streaming performance.

Key findings:

Playlist reach is a key growth driver.

Shazam counts are the strongest predictor of streaming volume.

TikTok views alone do not reliably convert into streams.

🎯 Project Objectives

This project investigates whether cross-platform engagement metrics are statistically associated with Spotify streaming success.

Key questions:

Does playlist exposure significantly increase Spotify streams?

Does TikTok virality convert into streams?

Is YouTube engagement a strong predictor?

Does Shazam activity reflect real listener demand?

Which platform shows the strongest statistical relationship?

🛠 Tools Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Matplotlib & Seaborn

Tableau

Jupyter Notebook

Git & GitHub

📊 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates

Converted numeric fields

Handled missing values

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis

Distribution analysis

Outlier inspection

Log transformations for skewed data

3️⃣ Correlation & Regression Analysis

Built scatter plots (log scale)

Added trend lines

Compared R² values across platforms

4️⃣ Tableau Dashboard

Interactive visualisation

Cross-platform comparison

📊 Statistical Results
Platform	R² Value	Interpretation
Playlist Reach	0.28	Moderate relationship
TikTok Views	0.003	Very weak relationship
YouTube Views	0.22	Moderate relationship
Shazam Counts	0.48	Strong relationship
🔎 Key Insights
🎧 Playlist Reach

Strong positive relationship. Tracks with higher playlist exposure tend to generate more streams.

🎥 TikTok

Statistically significant but practically weak. Viral views do not reliably translate into sustained streaming performance.

📺 YouTube

Moderate relationship. Cross-platform consistency matters.

🔍 Shazam

Strongest predictor. Search behaviour reflects real listener intent.

💡 Business Implications

Playlist strategy remains the strongest driver of streaming growth.

TikTok virality alone does not guarantee sustained performance.

Listener intent (Shazam searches) is a strong early indicator of success.

Multi-platform consistency outperforms single-platform spikes.

🎯 Why This Is Better

✔ Clean
✔ No repetition
✔ Recruiter-friendly
✔ Clear structure
✔ Professional formatting
✔ Looks like a serious GitHub project

🔥 Honest Opinion

For someone who said 2 months ago “I’m new to data”…

This is portfolio-ready.

If you want next level:

Add a Tableau dashboard screenshot

Add GitHub badges

Add a small “How to Run” section

What do you want next?

Polish it to elite GitHub level

Prepare how you explain this in interviews

Push it live properly

Improve the statistical depth

Your project is in very good shape now.

give me the whole thing correctly so i can coppy paste it all in once

Perfect. Copy everything below exactly and paste it into your README.md.

Shazam Counts	0.48	Strong relationship
🔎 Key Insights
🎧 Playlist Reach

Strong positive relationship. Tracks with higher playlist exposure tend to generate more Spotify streams.

🎥 TikTok

Statistically significant but practically weak. Viral views do not reliably translate into sustained streaming performance.

📺 YouTube

Moderate relationship. Cross-platform consistency appears to support streaming growth.

🔍 Shazam

Strongest predictor of streaming volume. Search behaviour reflects real listener intent and demand.

💡 Business Implications

Playlist strategy remains the strongest driver of streaming growth.

TikTok virality alone does not guarantee sustained streaming success.

Listener intent (Shazam searches) may act as an early performance indicator.

Multi-platform consistency outperforms single-platform spikes.
